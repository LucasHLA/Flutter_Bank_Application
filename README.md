# flutter_application_bank

Hello everyone My name is Lucas Henrique, this is the first repository that i post here on github, its not too much its just a Bank application where you can deposit and withdraw from a fake account and see the recent transactions historic.
I did this application for a college test and i'm very proud of what i did consedering that it was the first one i did using all my knowledge in flutter so far.
Thank you very much for opening and looking at my project, fell free to make any improvements you'd like to do to make it looks better.

See you :D
